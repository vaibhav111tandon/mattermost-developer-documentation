      <description>Plugins are defined by a manifest file and contain at least a server or web app component, or both.
The Plugin Starter Template is a starting point and illustrates the different components of a Mattermost plugin.
A more detailed example is the Demo Plugin, which showcases many of the features of plugins.
Manifest The plugin manifest provides required metadata about the plugin, such as name and ID. It is defined in JSON or YAML.</description>

      <description>Once you have your server and webapp set up, you can start developing on plugins.
For developing on Mattermost-managed plugins, each plugin&amp;rsquo;s setup instructions can be found in the plugin repository&amp;rsquo;s README. Some plugins do not have external dependencies and require little to no setup, like the Todo Plugin while others require an external service to be set up, like the Jira Plugin and GitHub Plugin.
Set up your environment to deploy plugins Deploying with Local Mode Note: Deploying with Local Mode will only work for plugins that have been updated with the functionality from the Plugin Starter Template.</description>

      <description>Common make commands for working with plugins  make dist - Compile the plugin into a g-zipped file, ready to upload to a Mattermost server. The file is saved in the plugin repo&amp;rsquo;s dist folder. make deploy - Compiles the plugin using the make dist command, then automatically deploys the plugin to the Mattermost server make watch - Uses webpack&amp;rsquo;s watch feature to re-compile and deploy the webapp portion of your plugin on any change to the webapp/src folder make test - Runs the plugin&amp;rsquo;s server tests and webapp tests make check-style - Runs linting checks on the plugin&amp;rsquo;s server and webapp folders make enable - Enables the plugin on the Mattermost server make disable - Disables the plugin on the Mattermost server make reset - Disables and re-enables the plugin on the Mattermost server make debug-plugin - Starts a delve process and attaches it to your running plugin  You can run the development build of the plugin by setting the environment variable MM_DEBUG=1, or prefixing the variable at the beginning of the make command.</description>

      <description>Migrating Plugins from Mattermost 5.5 and earlier The plugin package exposed by Mattermost 5.6 and later drops support for automatically unmarshalling a plugin&amp;rsquo;s configuration onto the struct embedding MattermostPlugin. As server plugins are inherently concurrent (hooks being called asynchronously) and the plugin configuration can change at any time, access to the configuration must be synchronized.
Plugins compiled against 5.5 and earlier will continue to work without modification, automatically unmarshalling a plugin&amp;rsquo;s configuration but with the existing risk of a corrupted read or write.</description>

      <description>Getting your plugin onto our Community server https://community.mattermost.com is a valuable source of feedback. Whether you are a Core Committer or anyone from the community, we want you to get feedback to improve your plugin.
However we must ensure that our Community server remains stable for everyone. This document outlines the process of getting your plugin onto the Community server and some of these steps are required to get your plugin into the Plugin Marketplace.</description>

      <description>Once your plugin has reached a certain level of quality, you might consider submitting it to the Plugin Marketplace. The Plugin Marketplace is a platform that supports discovery, installation and updates of plugins directly within Mattermost. It&amp;rsquo;s a great way to get feedback on your plugin and help make it more popular. Once your plugin is accepted to the Marketplace, Mattermost will also send you swag!
Requirements for Adding A Community Plugin to the Marketplace Every community plugin must fulfill the following checklist to be added to the Marketplace:</description>

      <description>See here for server-specific best practices for plugins. Webapp-specific best practices are incoming.
How can a plugin enable its configuration through the System Console? Once a plugin is installed, Administrators have access to the plugin&amp;rsquo;s configuration page in the System Console &amp;gt; Plugins section. The configurable settings must first be defined in the plugin&amp;rsquo;s manifest setting schema. The web app supports several basic pre-defined settings type, e.g. bool and dropdown, for which the corresponding UI components are provided in order to complete configuration in the System Console.</description>

      <description>Some plugins authored by Mattermost are licensed under the Mattermost Source Available License. This document outlines how to apply the license in various situations.
How do I apply the license to an Enterprise-only plugin? An Enterprise-only plugin is a plugin that requires a valid Mattermost Enterprise E20 license. It is not designed to be used with Team Edition or any other Enterprise license.
 Add the LICENSE file to the root of your plugin repository.</description>

      <description>The plugin architecture consists of an API, hooks, and plugin helpers.
When a plugin invokes an API method, it makes an RPC call to the Mattermost server and waits for a response. When the Mattermost server invokes a hook method, it makes an RPC call to the plugin and waits for a response:
// OnActivate is a hook called by the server when the plugin is started. func (p *Plugin) OnActivate() error { // CreatePost is an API called by the plugin to create a post.</description>
